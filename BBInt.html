<b><img src="pot.jpg" align=left>Baryon-Baryon Interactions.</b>
Several times in physics 
elementary structures have been discovered not to be so 
elementary but being composites of more microscopic objects.
This happened, for instance, with the discovery of atoms and 
molecules as being the elementary pieces from which gases and 
liquids were made. Another quite important case is the 
discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons as being the
building pieces of all the matter known at the 
begining of past century. <p>
Now protons and neutrons, nucleons, are believe to be 
made up of quarks as well as the crazy amount of particles 
that were discovered during the second half of past century.
<p>
With this new elementary particles it is of main importance to 
be able to understand the behavior of their composites, and 
their interactions. 
From this point of view strong interactions, the interaction
that bounds toghether protons and neutrons to form nuclei, is 
nothing more than a remnant of the interactions between quarks
as Van der Waals forces are remnant of the interctions between 
atoms.
<p>
In the literature there are two main methods that are used 
in order to calculate baryon-baryon interactions from 
the microscopics quark-quark intereactions:<p>
     -<b> Resonant Group Method</b>  This method proposes a 
          way of obtaning a dynamical equation 
          for the movement of the intercluster variable. 
Was first proposed to study interactions between tritium.<p>
     -<b> Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</b> This is 
a direct aplication of the standar BO approximation to 
the problem of six quarks clustered in groups of 3, two
baryons. The main withdraw is that no fluctuations of 
the center of mass motion of the system are considered.
